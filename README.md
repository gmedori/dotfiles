# dotfiles

**Warning:** My `install.sh` script is extremely destructive and personal and
will totally pollute your system with a bunch of crap you don't want. I use it
as a way to get a new machine up and running ASAP. If you're going to use my
dotfiles (and this applies to any time you're googling around for rc/setup
files), use it as inspiration and copy relevant snippets; don't just blindly
install all the stuff I install because you're going to have a bad time.

This is a repo where I version control all of my dotfiles. Currently, I have a
custom iTerm2 color scheme inspired by the [badwolf
colorscheme](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf). All the other colors that are set
in Tmux and Fish simply use the ANSI colors and so they take on the colors of
the iTerm2 colorscheme. Vim uses the real badwolf colorscheme. Here are some
screenshots:
